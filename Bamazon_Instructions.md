# **"How to Use" Instructions**

* To begin, lets create the database first.
	* Create an sql connection.
	* In the db_connection.js file, put in your host name, port you are using for this connection, and the user under which this connection is made.
		Also put in the password for this connection.
	* In the `Database` folder, open the db_statement_initalization.sql file. Copy all of the commands in this file,
		and run these commands on a fresh page in your MySQL Workbench application or equivalent.
	* Import the stock_dump.csv file to fill the schema you just created from the previous step.
	* Run bamazonCustomer.js from the command line, and voila, you are ready to go!
